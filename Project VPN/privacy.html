    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: <strong>November 28, 2025</strong></p>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>NexusVPN (“we”, “us”, or “NexusVPN”) provides virtual private network services to help protect users' privacy and secure their internet traffic. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> When you create an account or purchase a subscription we collect contact and billing information such as email and billing address.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment information:</strong> We do not store raw card details on our servers. Payments are processed by our payment provider. We only store references (transaction IDs) necessary to manage subscriptions and refunds.</li>
        <li><strong>Service-related data:</strong> To operate the VPN service we may collect minimal connection metadata (timestamps, bandwidth usage, server endpoints assigned) strictly for service operation and troubleshooting.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>No-Logs Commitment</h2>
      <p>We are committed to a strict no-logs policy for user activity. We do not log the websites you visit, the content of your communications, or DNS queries. Connection metadata retention is minimized and retained only as necessary for billing, abuse prevention, or legal compliance — and only in anonymized or aggregated form whenever possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use collected information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain the service</li>
        <li>Process payments and manage subscriptions</li>
        <li>Respond to support requests</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent abuse and fraud</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We use third-party service providers (payment processors, analytics, hosting) who only receive the data necessary to perform their services. These providers are contractually required to protect your data and use it only for the agreed purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system can be completely secure — use of our service is at your own risk.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>Our service is not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy on this page with a revised effective date.</p>
